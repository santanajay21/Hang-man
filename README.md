# Hang-man
In this python mini project I had to implement all of the methods I have been learning. What I found most challenging about creating this game was the logic behind it. At first I had to see documentation in order to complete it, but after that I started to understand the logic and indentation placement.
As I continue to learn this language I will continue to code projects like this to sharpen my python skills.
